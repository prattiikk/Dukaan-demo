# Dukaan Demo Challenge

## live demo is hosted on [ Dukaan-Demo](https://dukaan-demo-pi.vercel.app/Payments)

This project is my response to a frontend development challenge presented by **Subhash Choudhary** on Twitter. The challenge was to transform a Figma design into a functional website within a two-day timeframe.

## Challenge Highlights

- **Hosted By:** Subhash Choudhary

- **Challenge Duration:** 2 Days

## Design Overview

You can check out the Figma design here: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/1QTpfgcJLng3SEHv3V7Nr4/?viewer=1&node-id=0%3A5723&fuid=1221104466944091979)

## Tech Stack Used

- **Frontend Framework:** React

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI

- **Icons:** React-icons

- **Routing:** React Router dom

## How to Get Started

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

```bash

git clone https://github.com/prattiikk/Dukaan-demo.git

```

2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**

```bash

cd Dukaan-demo

```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

```bash

npm install

```

4.  **Run the Project:**

```bash

npm run start

```

Now, you can access the project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

- There's a 'components' folder housing essential components.

- The 'app.js' file contains routing using the DaisyUI drawer component, though it might need some cleanup.

- In the 'pages' folder, you'll find two pages: 'Payments' (as per the challenge) and a default 'Home' component.

## Challenges Encountered

- Implementing pagination was a bit tricky, so I sought guidance from ChatGPT for some assistance.

- As a newcomer to Tailwind, I encountered a few uncertainties that ChatGPT helped me resolve.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance code responsiveness for various screen sizes.

- Refine the pagination logic for better performance.

- Replace static data rendering in the card components with dynamic mapping once the actual data is available.

## Shoutouts

A special thank you to Subhash Choudhary for presenting this engaging design challenge, encouraging the frontend community to elevate their skills.
